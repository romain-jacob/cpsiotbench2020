Unique to this workshop, we seek reports describing the reproduction of experimental results reported in published papers. Examples of this include researchers looking to validate another piece of work before comparing their own to it, or industrial organizations evaluating a new technology or demonstrating the robustness of their technology before customer delivery.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>See the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/cpsbench20.ethz.ch\/call-for-papers\/\">Call for Papers<\/a>\u00a0for more details.<\/p>\n<p>CPS-IoTBench 2020 is a satellite workshop of the <a href=\"https:\/\/sigmobile.org\/mobicom\/2020\/\">Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (MobiCom 2020)<\/a>.<\/p>\n\t<b>Important update!<br \/>\n<\/b>Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the MobiCom organizers have decided to push the workshop submission deadline by 3 weeks (from May 15 to June 5).<br \/>\nThe CPSIoTBench notification date is pushed by a few days (from July 1 to July 6.<br \/>\nThe camera-ready deadline remains unchanged (July 31)\n\t<strong>Previous editions<br \/>\n<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/cpsbench2018.ethz.ch\/\">1st Workshop on Benchmarking Cyber-Physical Networks and Systems<\/a>, Porto 2018.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/cps-iotbench2019.ethz.ch\/\">2nd Workshop on Benchmarking Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet of Things<\/a>, Montr\u00e9al 2019.\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thank you for participating in CPS-IoTBench 2020!
