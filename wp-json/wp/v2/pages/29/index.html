Despite many successes, it is difficult to measure and compare the utility of these results due to a lack of standard evaluation criteria and methodologies. This problem inhibits evaluation against the state-of-the-art, the comparability of different integrated designs (e.g., control and networking), and the applicability of tested scenarios to present and future real-world cyber-physical applications and deployments. This state of affairs is alarming, it significantly hinders further progress in CPS and IoT systems research.<\/p>\n<p>The Workshop on Benchmarking Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet of Things (CPS-IoTBench) brings together researchers from the different sub-communities to engage in a lively debate on all facets of rigorously evaluating and comparing cyber-physical networks and systems. Unique to this workshop, we seek reports describing the reproduction of experimental results reported in published papers. Examples of this include researchers looking to validate another piece of work before comparing their own to it, or industrial organizations evaluating a new technology or demonstrating the robustness of their technology before customer delivery.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We invite researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to submit papers focusing on one of the following topics:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>describe an attempt to reproduce experimental results from published work;<\/li>\n<li>identify fundamental challenges and open questions in rigorous benchmarking and evaluation of cyber-physical networks and systems;<\/li>\n<li>report on success stories or failures with using standard evaluation criteria;<\/li>\n<li>present example benchmark systems and approaches from any of the relevant communities (embedded systems, networking, control, robotics, machine learning, etc.);<\/li>\n<li>propose new research directions, methodologies, or tools to increase the level of reproducibility and comparability of evaluation results;<\/li>\n<li>report on examples of best practices in different CPS sub-communities towards achieving the repeatability of results;<\/li>\n<li>present models to capture and compare the properties of algorithms and systems.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations are sufficient to support a paper\u2019s claims.\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"OA\">Open Access and Open Review<\/h3>\n<p>The organizers of CPS-IoTBench are advocates of Open Science, which principles we want to promote with this workshop.
